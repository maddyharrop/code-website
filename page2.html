<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2: Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful</h2>

<h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed </h3>

<div class="review">
    <p>Visual Studio Code is a very helpful tool especially for someone like me starting out with no experience in coding. The option to press tab and get all the options of the CSS helps out when trying to figure out what would look and work best in the website.</p>
    <p>I used trello to plan out the pages of the website and each outcome that was needed to talk about. I enjoyed the layout of the trello and the way you can add notes to each section.</p>
    <p>I also used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"target="_blank">W3Schools</a> to help with different types of CSS. It I was very helpful when trying to add different styles to my website. W3schools have some great tool and even a ‘Try it yourself’ option to be able to see the code in action. </p>
    <p>I used Google search to be able to get information on outcome 1 and the way that IT is used in modern business. I think that this was helpful but I will be this discussing more in 2.2 and how appropriate each IT tool way. </p>
</div>

<h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate </h3>
<div class="review">
    <p>I believe that all the tools I used were appropriate. As I am new to this type of work and coding, I think that we have some great tools to complete the project. I think that given more time and more understanding of other tools available there could have been some changes depending on if I found some better tools. </p>
    <p>One tool that was challenging to use was google. I was difficult as a first-time coder to be able to work my answers correctly as sometimes I didn’t know what the issue was called.</p>
</div>

<h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project </h3>

<div class="review">
    <p>Using the SWOT analysis technique, I can map out the websites: strengths, weaknesses, opportunity’s and threats. This can help for when we want to improve or change the website. </p>
    <div class="tablet"><table rules="all">
        <tr>
            <th>Strengths</th>
            <th>Weaknesses</th>
            <th>Opportnity's</th>
            <th>Threats</th>
        </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Wide appeal design</td>
        <td>Lack of mobile support</td>
        <td>New emerging technology</td>
        <td>Peer copying</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Useful and relevant content</td>
        <td>No search bar for structure </td>
        <td>New design trends</td>
        <td>Copyright (if published)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Helpful and clear navigation bar</td>
        <td>Looks dissimilar on different browsers</td>
        <td>Upgrading browser software</td>
        <td>Broken code with new browser</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>No broken links</td>
        <td>Broken contact form</td>
        <td>New CSS types</td>
        <td>Hacking </td>
    </tr>
    </table></div>

    </div>

<h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project  </h3>

<div class="review"><p>I think that my website it clean and accessible. Given more time there is a lot that I could improve, I think that I would need to do some more independent learning and maybe try and get on to a higher-level course in coding. </p>
<p>One main thing that I would improve would be the contact page, making it easier to be able to add in a name, email and message and sending it direct from the website to me. To be able to do this, I would need to research ways of doing this and put time aside to be able to implement it into my CSS. </p>
<p>I would also improve the layout of the page making sure that everything was in line and that the padding and margins where perfect. </p>
<p>I would like to be able to implement a class to different lists because, I made the navigation bar an unordered list and put the style I wanted in the CSS. This meant that any other unordered list in my text had the same layout as the navigation bar. I did try to be able to fix this but I realised that I was taking time away from completing the written work and that it was not a priority. </p>
</div>

<h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose  </h3>

<div class="review">
    <p>The requirements were to create a website using VS code, HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS work together to make up a final web page, its design and the content that Is on it. VS code makes it possible to create multiple web pages to create one whole website, it also gives up a programme to be able to use HTML and CSS.</p> 
    <p>According to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-popular-technologies"target="_blank">StackOverflow’s 2019 Developer Survey</a>, which studied more than 90,000 developers and their thoughts on programming, HTML and CSS together ranked #2 on the list of top programming, scripting, and markup languages. I believe that all these tools fit the purpose of having to create a website with a blog.</p></div>
