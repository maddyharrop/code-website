<h2>Unit one, Outcome 1: Plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs</h2>

<div><h3>1.1	Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h3></div>

<div class="purpose"><p>The importance of IT in modern business has a wide rage of purpose for any businesses</p>

<div class="center">Digital marketing is more efficient than high cost newspaper television, and radio advertising.
<br>
Social networking is more efficient than going to clubs.
<br>     
VoiP communication is more efficient than legacy telephone. 
<br>      
Cloud computing is more efficient than a private computer network.</div>  
<br>
<div><p>The IT revolution has given business the tools to solve complex problems. For example, with the improvement of hardware combining smart applications it has made it easier to research data, analyse it and plan the growth of the business. There are many tools available and they will be discussed on 1.2.</p>

<p>IT allows business to make better decisions. For example, IT companies utilizing this technology are able to gain great market research. Online market research can be done in many ways and will be discussed in 1.2.</p>

<p>IT has been a massive influence to improve marketing. Using market research allows companies to target certain audiences, helping to discover their needs and building a marketing plan and campaign to persuade target audiences to buy.</p>

<p>IT has improved customer support. For example, as a company you have a many range of channels to offer customer support: telephone, email, website, social media and many more. This can help to improve customer relationships as having a fast and effective support system can increase repeat purchasing and improve customer advocacy.</p>

<p>IT has improved resource management. Cloud computing allows a company and its employees to use any device anywhere in the word to access their information and software.</p></div></div>



<div><h3>1.2	Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3></div>
<br>
<div class="purpose"><div><p>There are many resources that can be used to create digital projects. This all depends on what the project is. As discussed in 1.1 the IT revolution has given business the tools to solve complex problem. For example, when creating our game in the last project, we used many different tools available such as;
    <br>
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> is a code editor redefined and optimised for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.python.org/"target="_blank">Python</a> is a not necessarily a tool however, there are many high-level, general purpose programming languages which can be used to create digital projects.
    <br> 
    Mind mapping software and collaborative software like Kanban board which we used in the form <a href="https://trello.com/b/SNTPHhXU/thegame"target="_blank">Trello</a> can help to organise a team and research gained online. 
    <div><a href="https://trello.com/b/hFNyrRzB/maddys-website"target="_blank"><img class="trello" src="trello.PNG" alt="Trello"></a></div>
    <br>
    Market research tools- video conferences, social media, industry forums, online surveys and tools such as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjMzYqQkYTrAhUwURUIHe1nCAkQFjAAegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.google.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw1Jx9i6a4S_nl7I67YnB98r"target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>
    </p></div></div>
<br>

<div><h3>1.3	Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h3></div>
<br>
<div class="purpose"><div><p>Is important to have the correct equipment when creating a digital project. There are many things to take in to account when creating your digital project considerations need to be made to whether you need to be able to work on the go or the time limit you have. When starting my digital project, I needed tools such as: a computer, monitor, a mouse, keyboard, stable internet connection, zoom account, trello account and many more.</p>

<p>I created a <a href="https://trello.com/b/SNTPHhXU/thegame"target="_blank">trello board</a> to be able to plan and create my website. In addition, I used microsoft word document to be able to write with spelling and grammar corrections.</p></div></div>
<br>

<div><h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3></div>
<br>
<div class="purpose"><p>With every project comes risks that can impact the way things run, this is something that needs to be taken in to consideration when planning. When starting a project, it is important to make sure that you have a stable internet connection, without having an internet connection or a connection that drops this can make the project time longer and can impact planning if for example you were using a trello board.</p>
<p>In addition, issues with the VS code can halt the project all together, this can take time to figure out why certain things arenâ€™t updating or why the code itself has an error.</p> 
<p>Sometimes there are ways you can prepare for issues such as having extra help on hand, so that when issues arise, they can assist. In addition, having an offline back up of plans such as trello in a word document in the event of not having access to the internet.</p></div>

<div><h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3></div>
<br>
<div class="purpose"><p>Researching available tool and cataloguing individual features of each so be able to see which one suit your digital project best. Talking and networking with other developers can help to provide feedback and influence your decision.</p> 
<p>For example, when making the game we decided that trello and draw.io were the best tools to complete the job we were assigned. We also decided to use word documents to be able to create offline backups of everything we put in trello and <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/"target="_blank">draw.io</a>. This also made it easier to be able to share between each member of the group.</p></div>

<div><h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3></div>
<br>
<div class="purpose"><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> was a really useful program making it simple to be able to use python and also the programme easily defines the errors in the code and where they are so that it was possible to quickly fix issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://trello.com/b/SNTPHhXU/thegame"target="_blank">Trello</a> has significantly helped in terms of organisation. The Kanban style of do, doing and done was helpful to be able to set out what each team member would be doing during the time of the project.</p> 
<p><a href="https://github.com/"target="_blank">GitHut</a> is used for the final product of the project it provides a web-based graphical interface. In addition, it provides access control and several collaboration features to be able to share to project between peers and prospective employer. </p></div>

<div><h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3></div>
<br>
<div class="purpose"><p>Digital transformation impacts data protection, IT security, contract design, liability and regulation. More information on the Details Economy act 2017 these issues can be found <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/30/contents/enacted"target="_blank">here</a> here.</p>
<h4><span class="material-icons">filter_drama</span> Cloud computing</h4>
<p>Many companies are moving their IT infrastructure and applications into the cloud in order to guarantee anytime access. While cloud computing increases efficiency and saves cost it also comes with a number off considerable legal issues. There are many legal issues to take in to consideration. </p>
<h4><span class="material-icons">phonelink</span> Digital Media</h4>
<p>Digital media needs legal frame work, things to take into consideration include; content licenses and liability for said content, business structure and monetising models, regulatory issues such as protection of minors and data protection and draft and negotiating cooperation agreements. </p>
<h4><span class="material-icons">credit_card</span> E-payments</h4>
<p><a href="https://cms.law/en/deu/insight/digital-transformation/e-payment"target="_blank">Electronic payments</a> have become an essential part of any online business transaction. There are a growing number of alternative payment service providers making online purchasing safer for customers. The EU Payment Service Directive (PSD) provides the legal framework for e-payments. E-commerce providers need to comply with a number of information requirements, deadlines and liability regulations. </p>
<h4><span class="material-icons">computer</span> IT security</h4>
<p>The EU has been discussing ways to create a cyber security strategy with aims to make e commerce safer. Something to consider for an online business include; data protection, privacy due diligence, in house data protection officers and obligations that are implemented by the government.</p>
<h4><span class="material-icons">sports_esports</span> Gaming and E-sports</h4>
<p>As online gaming and e-sports continue to grow there are also massive legal guidelines and constrains game developers and companies need to think about when working on projects. These issues include many that have been talked about previously in 1.7 but in addition to this; consumer protection, copyright, terms and conditions, privacy and cookies and many more.</p>
<h4><span class="material-icons">lock</span> General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)</h4>
<p><a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/"target="_blank">GDPR</a> include 7 key principles: 
<ol>
    <li>Lawfulness</li>
    <br>
    <li>Fairness</li>
    <br>
    <li>Transparency</li>
    <br>
    <li>Purpose limitations</li>
    <br>
    <li>Data minimisations</li>
    <br>
    <li>Accuracy storage limitations</li>
    <br>
