<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3: Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems </h2>

<h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency </h3>
<div class="review">
    <p>As discussed throughout this website there were a lot of IT tools and systems that were used to create this website. VScode was a really useful program making it simple to be able to use HTML and CSS. HTML made it easy to define the structure and content of the web pages. I implemented all my heading in to the HTML first to be able to show how the rest of the content would fit inside it. CSS defines the styling and presentation of a web pages and the elements in it. It was productive to be able to have the CSS open in VS Code and the website side by side so that I could instantly save and refresh the code and the site to see the visual changes. </p>
    <p>Trello has significantly helped in terms of organisation. It also helped with productivity, when stuck on what to do next it helped to remind me of what I needed to do. <p>
    <p>Using zoom with my peers when issues arose was very helpful not only for me but also my peer, we were able to bounce ideas of one another and gain some feedback in to the work we were doing. </p>
    <p>Whilst it would be helpful to split the work, I think that everyone has their own style to being able to come to an agreement on the maybe ways you can visually change the CSS would be difficult. Unless there was a brief set for by a company, I don’t see the use in using teams to create a website this specific size and the type in content it</p>

<h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
<div class="review">
    <p>Working from home has its advantages and its disadvantages. Being able to work at my own pace with no stress or pressure is enjoyable however there are downsides to this. I would get distracted easily being on my own computer, with the options to be able to listen to music or even watch videos while working didn’t help my productivity. To improve this could be working at the school in Manchester or setting up limits to when I can open certain webpages e.g. not between the hours of 10am and 5pm.</p>
    <p>As someone who suffers with dyslexia, I find it quite difficult to put my thoughts in to words in addition to this, I read around 50% slower than some people. When in University I had a laptop with tools to help me with this. I don’t have these tools anymore but, it would improve my productivity and efficiency to have a program that dictates what I am reading and what I am writing. Furthermore, I would benefit from having the autocorrect software which works on the whole computer not just the word document. </p>
</div>

<h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>
<div class="review">
    <p>There is always room improve. Things I would benefit from to improve productivity using IT in digital projects include; leaning more keyboard shortcuts to be able to make changes to not just the code but also word documents and web browsers, greater use of the trello board and also saving an offline copy of helpful webpages so that in the event of technical issues I can continue to be productive. In addition, I could use slack more to be able to get feedback from peers about my word and the spelling and grammar. </p>
    <p>Peer assessment is very useful, it provides a structured learning process. Peer assessment can help to empower students to take responsibility and manage their own learning. It also motives student to engage with the course material with different viewpoints. </p>
    <p>It would be beneficial to me to track and limit how much time I was spending on each task this could have been noted using the trello board. This would help me to get regular breaks away from the screen in order to refresh my mind and create clear and decisive work.</p>
    </div>

<h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
<div class="review">
    <p>Digital testing is very important, when it comes to creating a website there are many things to take in to consideration such as mobile web, desktop browser and many more platforms. Digital testing may include usability testing, accessibility testing and <a href="https://www.perfecto.io/resources/types-of-testing"target="_blank">many more</a>. </p>
    <p>Throughout the whole process I made sure to regularly check my work. As mentioned before, I was able to have my VS code and my website side by side in order to be efficient and productive in my checking. I believe that more research could have been done in order to find better solutions in to checking and correcting the CSS, HTML and the written work.</p> 
    <p>I was able to use Zoom meeting in order to be able to get quick feedback about big issues surrounding my work and this was effective for both me and my peer.
