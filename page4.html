<h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1: Create structures and styles for a webpage</h2>
<br>

<h3>1.1	Describing the content and layout for each page </h3>
<div class="purpose">
    <p>When creating this website my first thought was to create a nice background for the body. I searched for different seamless backgrounds and tried many before deciding to settle on the current one. I chose this because I think that it is simple and modern, without being too chaotic. In addition, the science, gaming and mathematical theme reflects on my personality.</p>
    <p>I decided to colour match the border and background of text to the body background. I think that it contrasts nicely and makes it easy to read. I chose the font “Fancois One” as it is a font I have used in the past and for me personally it is easy to read with my dyslexia. The text box is used throughout the webpages for both the paragraphs and heading. </p>
    <p>I decided add icons to the navigation bar as a visual guide to show what each page was on. I used a combination of Google Icons and Font Awesome icons. In addition, I added them on page 1, “Unit 1: 01” to create a clean list when talking about legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects. </p>
    <p>On my “Contact Me” page I decided to have two text boxes; one including a online form to be able to add name, E-mail and a message to me and another which contained my phone number, email, LinkedIn and GitHub. </p>
    <p>On my final page I embedded an iframe to be able to add my game from unit 1 as a trinket so that it would be able to be played from the website itself.</p>

<h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
<div class="purpose">
    <p>The online world allows for the free flow of information this includes text and graphics. This can lead to a problem, online content no matter what form can be easy for anyone to steal and use as their own. There are many ways to avoid this and also ways as a user to avoid unlawfully stealing other people’s content. </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/website-copyright-law/#Specific_Laws"target="_blank">Copyright</a> refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression.” Occasionally copyright laws protection overlaps with other kind of intellectual property laws. Each country has their own copyright acts and they can be viewed here:</p>
    <p>In the U.S there is a copyright protection called the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/"target="_blank">“Copyright Act of 1976”</a>, it grants authors and artists the rights to reproduce, distribute and display their works</p>
    <p>The law in the U.K. is the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/contents"target="_blank">“Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988”</a> It is quite similar the US “Copyright Act of 1976” which includes laws to protect original creations involving literary work, music, art, film and sound.</p>
    <p>In Australia there is a copyright law set out in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00180"target="_blank">“Copyright Act 1968”</a> In Australia unlike the U.K. and U.S, it does not have a registration process so any disputes have to be resolved in civil court.  </p>
    <p>The <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/Index.html"target="_blank">“Copyright Act”</a> in Canada in enforce by the Intellectual Property Office and is similar to the other laws from different countries.</p>
    <p>In the U.K. copyright infringement can lead to substantial penalties. Upon conviction in the magistrates’ court the maximum term of incarceration in the U.K. for copyright infringement is 6 months and/or a fine of up to £50,000. </p>
    <p>There are a few ways in making sure that your own content is protected by Copyright. Ensuring that the work in properly marked, stating a notice that the work is protected. In addition, you can register your work with a copyright registration service so that in event of your work being plagiarised you have proof that you own it. Furthermore, if your work is a joint project, having a clear understanding of who owns what work and what happens when someone’s leaves can help to protect all parties. </p>

<h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account </h3>
<div class="purpose">
    <p>There are many disabilities and conditions that need to be taken in to consideration when creating a website, making it more accessible. Some of the most common categories of impairments include: visual impairments, hearing impartments, motor skills and physical disabilities, photosensitive seizures and cognitive disabilities. </p>
    <p>One way to make websites more accessible is to make sure the site is keyboard friendly. Making the website work without the use of a mouse will help people with disabilities or conditions. </p>
    <p>Another way to make it more accessible is to add alt text to all images so that screen readers can tell the user what the image is about.</p>
    <p>Taking in to consideration the use of colours in the website can help those with colour blindness and also those who suffer from visual stress linked with dyslexia. Ideally it is most helpful to have a contrast of a dark color against a light one. </p>
    <p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of speech synthesis application that is used to create spoken sound versions of the text in a computer document. There are numerous TTS products and it is important to make sure that you text a few different products to ensure that TTS users can access your website. In addition, there is an option when writing HTML to be able to add semantic tags in order for users who are visually impaired and using Text to Speech software to hear what each component is. </p>

<h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
<div class="purpose">
    <p>Web pages are files which hold information to be presented, and they are stored on computers called ‘Web Servers’. Computers reading the web pages are called ‘Web Clients’ and a Web Client read the pages with a program called the ‘Web browser’. Popular web browsers are ‘Google Chrome’ and ‘Mozilla-Firefox’.</p>
    <p>HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language file format used as the basis of a web page. HTML consists of markup tags surrounded by angle brackets. The HTML can be used to define heading, paragraphs, list, links and many more. It can also be used to embed CSS. The markup tag tells thee Web browser how to display the page.</p>
    <p>There are many different filetypes that can be implemented in HTML to show inside webpages. </p>
    <p>All images are made up from either raster or vector files types. Raster images are built through a series of pixels, whereas vector files are built using proportional formulas. </p>
    <p>Images have different filetypes such as JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP and many more deciding which is appropriate depends on how you are going to use them in the website. For example, using a PNG image file will retain a higher quality image to size ratio due to the lossless compression file process. <a href="https://www.canto.com/blog/png-image-file/#:~:text=png%20is%20a%20lossless%20compression,the%20quality%20is%20the%20same"target="_blank">A lossless compression</a> means the images lose information quality once the file size decreases. One of the main drawbacks of using PNGs, is that some web browsers do not support them. If your logo is saved as a PNG and someone is viewing your website on a browser that does not support them, it simply won’t appear.</p>
    <p>In addition, to images there are also MP3 files for audio and MP4 files for video. These filetypes are small and easily implemented in to HTML however, deciding which is the most appropriate depends on the size, format and requirements for your website. </p>
