<div><h2>About me</h2></div>

<div class="about_me"><p> Welcome to my website, my name is Madeline Harrop and I am currently studying at <a href="http://wearecodenation.com/"target="_blank">Code Nation.</a> I am 23 years old and I graduated from the Manchester Metropolitan University with a BA (Hons) in Food Business Entrepreneurship. I would class my self as a foodie and I also have a level 1 award in wine. I spent 2 years at college studying level 2 and 3 in professional pastry, I then went on to work in the hospitality industry until November. I have a big in interest in IT and engagement through digital transformation.</p> 

<p>My first experience in gaming was on a Gameboy colour around 7 and I remember playing on with it on road trips. I then got a PS2 when I was around 8, I played games such as rachet and clank and racing games like F1 and need for speed. Growing up I then started playing on a Nintendo DS and really enjoyed this went on to later in life when I carried on with Nintendo and go at Wii and then this year, I got a Nintendo switch lite. As much as I have had a wide range of consoles, I am definitely a PC gamer.</p>

<p>I am a self-starter in IT. At 18 I decided to build my own PC, I found it extremely exciting to learn a new skill and I have gone on to learn more about computers. Over the course of the last 5 years, I have had to also teach myself how to troubleshoot issues with the PC and the BIOS. I am a big PC gamer and spend a lot of hours a week playing all sorts of types of games including: FPSâ€™s, dungeon crawlers, platformers, survival, horror and many, many more.</p>

<p>When I turned 18, I decided to create a Twitch account and I have been streaming for 5 years now. Though the platform and the gaming community I have attending gaming and networking event and made a lot of connections. Gaming is a massive part of my life and I would love to have the chance to work in the field of IT or gaming.</p>

<p>Throughout this website I will be discussing the uses of IT in modern business and IT tools and systems I have used over the duration of this course. </p></div>
